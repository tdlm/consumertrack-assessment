## Development

The micronaut theme included with this repo comes with a series of Gulp commands that will help to facilitate easy dev!

To get started, CD into the theme directory and fire up one of the available commands:

- `npx gulp` (alias for build)
- `npx gulp build` (Runs JS, SASS commands in sequence)
- `npx gulp js` (Runs theme.js through Babel, then Terser, then renames to theme.min.js)
- `npx gulp sass` (Runs theme.scss through gulp-sass w/ compression, autoprefixer, then renames to theme.min.css)
- `npx gulp serve` (Runs BrowserSync)
- `npx gulp watch` (Runs watcher to recompile JS/SCSS files on save)

### BrowserSync

Browser sync enables you to reload the browser when relevant files change. Once you've fired up the main WordPress Docker instance using the `Installation` instructions above, you can run the `npx gulp serve` command (or just `gulp serve` if you have Gulp installed globally).

```bash
$ cd content/themes/micronaut
$ npx gulp serve
[01:53:03] Starting 'serve'...
[01:53:03] Finished 'serve' after 27 ms
[Browsersync] Proxying: http://localhost
[Browsersync] Access URLs:
 ------------------------------------
       Local: http://localhost:3000
    External: http://192.168.1.5:3000
 ------------------------------------
          UI: http://localhost:3001
 UI External: http://localhost:3001
 ------------------------------------
```

Once this is running, any changes to the theme files (PHP, JS, SCSS) under `content/themes/micronaut` will result in a fresh compile and browser refresh.

### Watcher

If you don't feel like using `BrowserSync`, you're free to let Gulp watch your files for changes and you can refresh the browser whenever you see fit.

Any time the watcher sees changes to either JavaSript or SASS (scss) files under the `content/themes/micronaut/assets/src/` folder, it will trigger a recompile, but will not trigger a reload browser-side. If you want to run this, run `npx gulp watch` (or just `gulp watch` if you have Gulp installed globally).

```bash
$ cd content/themes/micronaut
$ npx gulp watch
[02:00:54] Starting 'watch'...
[02:00:54] Finished 'watch' after 18 ms
[02:01:08] Starting 'js'...
[02:01:08] Finished 'js' after 13 ms
[02:01:08] Starting 'sass'...
[02:01:08] Finished 'sass' after 3.55 ms
[02:01:13] Starting 'js'...
[02:01:13] Finished 'js' after 10 ms
[02:01:13] Starting 'sass'...
[02:01:13] Finished 'sass' after 3.09 ms
```

### JavaScript

The theme's JavaScript files live under `content/themes/micronaut/assets/src/js/`, and if you want to manually compile changes to them, just cd into the theme directory and run the `npx gulp js` command (or just `gulp js` if you have Gulp installed globally).

```bash
$ cd content/themes/micronaut
$ npx gulp js
[01:55:33] Starting 'js'...
[01:55:33] Finished 'js' after 8.84 ms
```

### SASS CSS

> NOTE: This theme extends Bootstrap.css

The theme's SASS files live under `content/themes/micronaut/assets/src/scss/`, and if you want to manually compile changes to them, just cd into the theme directory and run the `npx gulp sass` command (or just `gulp sass` if you have Gulp installed globally).

```bash
$ cd content/themes/micronaut
$ npx gulp sass
[01:58:28] Starting 'sass'...
[01:58:28] Finished 'sass' after 8.61 ms
```
